            <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
              <p>Aloha! My name is FLo and I am a full-time dad and hubby, part-time gamer. Born and raised in Hawai’i. I joined the US Army in 2009, and had the <em>pleasure</em> of vacationing in the sandstorms of Iraq during <strong>Operation New Dawn</strong>. I have a beautiful wife named Alyy who I occasionally game with, and a son named Keahe who is a future gaming nerd. I started streaming in 2019 with a MacBookPro and my wife’s PS4. Since then I’ve been upgrading my setup little by little to create better and better content. My schedule is a bit crazy at the moment, but I do keep up with the communities that I’m in. <strong>#StrengthThroughSupport</strong></p>
